<h1><font color = "red"> Understanding my stupid version system. </h1></font>
<p> Take the version 0.0.3a as an example, if it has a letter at the end of the version number, 
  that means its an update to the test branch of hotdog clicker. Say the version number is 0.0.3,
  if there is no letter at the end, that means that it is an update released to the main branch of hotdog clicker.
</p>
<br>

<h1><font color = "red"> Differences between the Test Branch and the Main Branch </h1></font>
<p> The test branch is meant for testing new changes to hotdog clicker before I add them to the game.
  I will hopefully have new things there weekly for people to test, however progress does not carry over between the main game and test branch.
  Nothing in the test branch is guaranteed to get added to the game. If something feels out of place, then it might not make it.
  The main game is the main version of the game, its the official release, how the game is currently meant to be played.
  I may occasionally have a second test branch running of hotdog clicker for LARGE drastic changes to the game, if so, it will be listed with its own navigation at the top to show it is open for people to play.

<h1><font color="red"> Roadmap </h1></font>
<p>
  -Hotdog Loans (75% chance to add)

</p>

<br>

<h1><font color = "red">What's New </h1></font>

<h1> Version 0.1 - "Fixing My Mistake Update" </h1>
<p>
  -Removed the hotdog president minigame as well as second currency. Reasoning for this is that it just wasn't that great or fun. If you disagree with that, go play another game then. This is my game, I do what I want with it.

<p>

<h1> Version 0.0.8 - "The Domination Update" </h1>
<p>
  -Added Hotdog Continent and Hotdog NATO.
